See <https://adventofcode.com/2020/> for a list of tasks.

To give the challenges an interesting twist, I coded the solutions
in an atypical language, [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) - a Lisp dialect.

Actually, not all of them in Clojure.
I failed in part B of day 19, which is currently written in Python;
tough I might try and rewrite it back in Clojure later.

Usage `./aoc.sh DAY [test]`.
